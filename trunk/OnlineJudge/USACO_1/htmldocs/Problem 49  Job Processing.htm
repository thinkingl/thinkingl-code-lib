<p>A factory is running a production line that requires two operations
to be performed on each job: first operation "A" then operation "B".
Only a certain number of machines are capable of performing each
operation.

Figure 1 shows the organization of the production line that works as
follows. A type "A" machine takes a job from the input container, performs
operation "A" and puts the job into the intermediate container.  A type
"B" machine takes a job from the intermediate container, performs
operation "B" and puts the job into the output container. All machines
can work in parallel and independently of each other, and the size of
each container is unlimited. The machines have different performance
characteristics, a given machine requires a given processing time for
its operation.

<p> Give the earliest time operation "A" can be completed for all N jobs
provided that the jobs are available at time 0. Compute the minimal
amount of time that is necessary to perform both operations (successively,
of course) on all N jobs.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: job</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td>
Three space-separated integers:
<ul>
<li> N, the number of jobs (1&lt;=N&lt;=1000).
</li><li>M1, the number of type "A" machines (1&lt;=M1&lt;=30)
</li><li>M2, the number of type "B" machines (1&lt;=M2&lt;=30)
</li></ul>
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Line 2..etc: </td> <td> M1 integers that are the job processing
times of each type "A" machine (1..20) followed by M2 integers, the job
processing times of each type "B" machine (1..20).
</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file job.in) </h3>

<pre>5 2 3
1 1 3 1 4
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line containing two integers:  the minimum time to perform all
"A" tasks and the minimum time to perform all "B" tasks (which require
"A" tasks, of course).

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file job.out)</h3>

<pre>3 5
