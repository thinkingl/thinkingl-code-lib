<P>Consider the following two-player game played with a sequence
of N positive integers (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 100) laid onto a game board.
Player 1 starts the game.  The players move alternately by selecting
a number from either the left or the right end of the sequence.
That number is then deleted from the board, and its value is added
to the score of the player who selected it.  A player wins if his
sum is greater than his opponents.

</P><P> Write a program that implements the optimal strategy.  The
optimal strategy yields maximum points when playing against the "best
possible" opponent.  Your program must further implement an optimal
strategy for player 2.
