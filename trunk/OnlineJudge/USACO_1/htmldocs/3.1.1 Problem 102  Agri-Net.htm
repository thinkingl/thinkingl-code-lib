<P> Farmer John has been elected mayor of his town!  One of his campaign
promises was to bring internet connectivity to all farms in the area.
He needs your help, of course.

</P><P> Farmer John ordered a high speed connection for his farm and is
going to share his connectivity with the other farmers.  To minimize
cost, he wants to lay the minimum amount of optical fiber to connect
his farm to all the other farms.

</P><P> Given a list of how much fiber it takes to connect each pair of
farms, you must find the minimum amount of fiber needed to connect them
all together.  Each farm must connect to some other farm such that a
packet can flow from any one farm to any other farm.

</P><P>The distance between any two farms will not exceed 100,000.

<H3>INPUT FORMAT</H3>

<TABLE border="1">
<TBODY><TR> <TD> Line 1: </TD> <TD> The number of farms, N (3 &lt;= N &lt;=
		             100).  </TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD> Line 2..end: </TD> <TD>
The subsequent lines contain the N x N connectivity matrix, where each
element shows the distance from on farm to another. Logically, they are
N lines of N space-separated integers.  Physically, they are limited in
length to 80 characters, so some lines continue onto others.  Of course,
the diagonal will be 0, since the distance from farm i to itself is not
interesting for this problem.

minimum length of fiber required to connect the entire set of farms.
