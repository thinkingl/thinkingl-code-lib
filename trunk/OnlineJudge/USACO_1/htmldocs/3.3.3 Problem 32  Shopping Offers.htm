<P> In a certain shop, each kind of product has an integer price.  For
example, the price of a flower is 2 zorkmids (z) and the price of a vase
is 5z.  In order to attract more customers, the shop introduces some
special offers.

</P><P> A special offer consists of one or more product items together for
a reduced price, also an integer.  Examples:
</P><UL>
<LI>three flowers for 5z instead of 6z, or
</LI><LI>two vases together with one flower for 10z instead of 12z.
</LI></UL>

<P> Write a program that calculates the price a customer has to pay for
a purchase, making optimal use of the special offers to make the price
as low as possible.  You are not allowed to add items, even if that
would lower the price.

</P><P> For the prices and offers given above, the (lowest) price for three
flowers and two vases is 14z:  two vases and one flower for the reduced
price of 10z and two flowers for the regular price of 4z.

<H3>INPUT FORMAT</H3>

<P>The input file has a set of offers followed by a purchase.
<TABLE border="1">
<TBODY><TR> <TD> Line 1: </TD> <TD>s, the number of special offers, (0 &lt;=
          s &lt;= 99).  </TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD> Line 2..s+1: </TD> <TD> Each line describes an offer using
several integers.  The first integer is n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 5), the number
of products that are offered.  The subsequent n pairs of integers c and
k indicate that k items (1 &lt;= k &lt;= 5) with product code c (1 &lt;=
c &lt;= 999) are part of the offer.  The last number p on the line stands
for the reduced price (1 &lt;= p &lt;= 9999).  The reduced price of an
offer is less than the sum of the regular prices.  </TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD> Line s+2: </TD> <TD>
The first line contains the number b (0 &lt;= b &lt;= 5) of different
kinds of products to be purchased. </TD></TR>
<TR> <TD> Line s+3..s+b+2: </TD> <TD> Each of the subsequent b lines
contains three values: c, k, and p.  The value c is the (unique) product
code (1 &lt;= c &lt;= 999).  The value k indicates how many items of
this product are to be purchased (1 &lt;= k &lt;= 5).  The value p is
the regular price per item (1 &lt;= p &lt;= 999).  At most 5*5=25 items
can be in the basket.  </TD> </TR>
