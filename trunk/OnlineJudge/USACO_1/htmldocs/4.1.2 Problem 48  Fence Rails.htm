<p> Farmer John is trying to erect a fence around part of his field.
He has decided on the shape of the fence and has even already installed
the posts, but he's having a problem with the rails.  The local lumber
store has dropped off boards of varying lengths; Farmer John must create
as many of the rails he needs from the supplied boards.

</p><p> Of course, Farmer John can cut the boards, so a 9 foot board can be
cut into a 5 foot rail and a 4 foot rail (or three 3 foot rails, etc.).
Farmer John has an `ideal saw', so ignore the `kerf' (distance lost
during sawing); presume that perfect cuts can be made.

</p><p> The lengths required for the rails might or might not include
duplicates (e.g., a three foot rail and also another three foot rail
might both be required).  There is no need to manufacture more rails
(or more of any kind of rail) than called for the list of required rails.

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50), the number of boards
                  </td> </tr>
