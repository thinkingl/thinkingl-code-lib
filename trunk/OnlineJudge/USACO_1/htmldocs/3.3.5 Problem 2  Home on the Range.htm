<P> Farmer John grazes his cows on a large, square field N (2 &lt;= N
&lt;= 250) miles on a side (because, for some reason, his cows will only
graze on precisely square land segments).  Regrettably, the cows have
ravaged some of the land (always in 1 mile square increments). FJ needs
to map the remaining squares (at least 2x2 on a side) on which his cows
can graze (in these larger squares, no 1x1 mile segments are ravaged).

</P><P> Your task is to count up all the various square grazing areas within
the supplied dataset and report the number of square grazing areas (of
sizes &gt;= 2x2) remaining. Of course, grazing areas may overlap for
purposes of this report.
