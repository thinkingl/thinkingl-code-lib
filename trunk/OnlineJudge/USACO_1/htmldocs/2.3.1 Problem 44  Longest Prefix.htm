<P>The structure of some biological objects is represented by the sequence
of their constituents denoted by uppercase letters. Biologists are
interested in decomposing a long sequence into shorter ones called
<I>primitives</I>.

</P><P>We say that a sequence S can be composed from a given set of primitives
P if there is a some sequence of (possibly repeated) primitives from
the set whose concatenation equals S.  Not necessarily all primitives
need be present.  For instance the sequence <TT>ABABACABAAB</TT>can be
composed from the set of primitives </P><PRE>	   {A, AB, BA, CA, BBC}
</PRE>

<P>The first K characters of S are the <I>prefix of </I>S with length
K.  Write a program which accepts as input a set of primitives and
a sequence of constituents and then computes the length of the longest
prefix that can be composed from primitives.

</P><H3>PROGRAM NAME: prefix</H3>

<H3>INPUT FORMAT</H3>

First, the input file contains the list (length 1..200) of primitives
(length 1..10) expressed as a series of space-separated strings of
upper-case characters on one or more lines.  The list of primitives is
terminated by a line that contains nothing more than a period (`.').
No primitive appears twice in the list.

Then, the input file contains a sequence S (length 1..200,000) expressed
as one or more lines, none of which exceed 76 letters in length.  The
"newlines" are not part of the string S.

<H3>SAMPLE INPUT (file prefix.in) </H3>

<PRE>A AB BA CA BBC
.
ABABACABAABC
</PRE>

<H3>OUTPUT FORMAT</H3>

A single line containing an integer that is the length of the longest
prefix that can be composed from the set P.
