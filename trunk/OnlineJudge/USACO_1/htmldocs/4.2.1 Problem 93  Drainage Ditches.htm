<p> Every time it rains on Farmer John's fields, a pond forms over
Bessie's favorite clover patch.  This means that the clover is covered
by water for awhile and takes quite a long time to regrow.  Thus, Farmer
John has built a set of drainage ditches so that Bessie's clover patch
is never covered in water.  Instead, the water is drained to a nearby
stream.  Being an ace engineer, Farmer John has also installed regulators
at the beginning of each ditch, so he can control at what rate water
flows into that ditch.

</p><p> Farmer John knows not only how many gallons of water each ditch
can transport per minute but also the exact layout of the ditches,
which feed out of the pond and into each other and stream in a
potentially complex network.  Note however, that there can be more
than one ditch between two intersections.

</p><p>Given all this information, determine the maximum rate at which water
can be transported out of the pond and into the stream.  For any given
ditch, water flows in only one direction, but there might be a way that
water can flow in a circle.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: ditch</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> Two space-separated integers, N (0 &lt;=
	 N &lt;= 200) and M (2 &lt;= M &lt;= 200).  N is the number of
	 ditches that Farmer John has dug.  M is the number of
	 intersections points for those ditches.  Intersection 1 is the
	 pond.  Intersection point M is the stream.  </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> Line 2..N+1: </td> <td> Each of N lines contains three integers,
	 S<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>, and C<sub>i</sub>.  S<sub>i</sub>
	 and E<sub>i</sub> (1 &lt;= S<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub> &lt;=
	 M) designate the intersections between which this ditch flows.
	 Water will flow through this ditch from S<sub>i</sub> to
	 E<sub>i</sub>.  C<sub>i</sub> (0 &lt;= C<sub>i</sub> &lt;=
	 10,000,000) is the maximum rate at which water will flow through
	 the ditch.  </td> </tr>
